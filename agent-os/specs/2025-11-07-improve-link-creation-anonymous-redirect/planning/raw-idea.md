# Raw Idea

## Feature Name
Improve link creation and Anonymous redirect

## Description
Anonymous Redirect - Do you want to link anonymously to other web sites without sending any referrer?

Use anon.to to de-referer or null-referer your links.

Just put http://anon.to/? in front of your links. Eg: http://anon.to/?http://www.google.com

## Context
This is for the anon.to project, a privacy-first URL shortener being rebuilt on Laravel 12. The current implementation (Phase 1-3) has basic link creation and redirect warning pages, but we want to improve these features.
